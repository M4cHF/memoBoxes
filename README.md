How MemoBoxes Works

The MemoBoxes project uses five virtual boxes to implement the spaced repetition technique. Here's how it works:

Creating Flashcards

Users create new flashcards, which are initially placed in Box 1.
Each flashcard contains the question, answer, and optional hints.
Review Process

Flashcards in Box 1 are reviewed every day.
If a user answers a flashcard correctly, it moves to the next box. If answered incorrectly, it remains in the current box.
Box Scheduling

Each box has a specific review interval to increase the time between repetitions as knowledge retention improves:
Box 1: Every day
Box 2: Every 3 days
Box 3: Every 7 days
Box 4: Every 14 days
Box 5: Every 30 days
Flashcards in Box 5 are considered well-learned and reviewed only occasionally.
Adaptive Learning

If a flashcard in any box is answered incorrectly, it is sent back to Box 1 for more frequent review.
User Experience

Users log in daily to see the cards due for review based on the box schedule.
A dashboard shows the status of all boxes and tracks learning progress over time.
